## Data Structures
When Data Structures, I decided to learn all the different versions and programming implementations. In this folder are all my implementations of Data Structures, written in both C and C++.

In the implementations where I have included DSA functions as methods. E.g. in Binary Search Tree I have a method to find the height of a BST.

You will find a folder called 'Practice' in each directory. This is me practicing, using 'Look, Cover, Write, Check', to ensure that I memorise this.
